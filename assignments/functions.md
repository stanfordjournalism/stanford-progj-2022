## Python functions

Read up on and practice with functions.

* Read [W3C Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) and do the [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_functions1).

* *Note required, but strongly encouraged*: Read [Chapter 3 - Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/) of *Automate the Boring Stuff*. You can stop right before the section on "Exceptions". **As always, you don't have to do the exercises but you should type in the commands for code examples throughout the text.**

* Read [Portable paths](../docs/python/portable_paths.md) and try creating some dummy directories and files that resemble those described in the examples in order to practice the techniques. For the environment variable section, you can simply use one of the  [Datakit](../docs/datakit.md) projects we created for an earlier assignment. These projects contain a `scripts/1-etl.py` script that demonstrates the environment variable approach.

    "# Tidy (Evictions) Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why tidy data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data comes in many shapes. Some are harder to work with than others due to how values and variables are organized in the form of rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of the data journalist's job involves transforming data into a structure suitable for analysis. Here's a bit of background on the importance of \"tidy\" data from [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), author of the [Tidy Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) standard and creator of many good things in the realm of data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you donâ€™t need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all sounds well and good, but a bit theoretical. Let's tidy up some real-world data in pursuit of a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meet the data\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to tidy up one example of \"messy\" data: [eviction notices in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Eviction-Notices/5cei-gny5). The data covers more than 20 years of eviction notices. The goal is to reshape this data into a form that lets us explore some basic journalistic questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the top reasons overall for evictions in San Francisco?\n",
    "* What patterns or trends can we discern for the top reasons over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we eyeball this data, we notice that it is \"wide.\" There are more than 29 columns, the majority of which represent individual causes for eviction. Some important details to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each row reflects a single eviction notice.\n",
    "* A property owner can cite one or more reasons for seeking to evict a tenant.\n",
    "* Each reason column has a value of `TRUE` if the reason was cited, or `FALSE` if it was not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![evictions-data](img/evictions_data_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## One flavor of messy\n",
    "\n",
    "The evictions data exemplifies one of several major types of messy data: [when column headers are values instead of variable names](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html#column-headers-are-values-not-variable-names). What do we mean by this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a bit of background from Tidy Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common type of messy dataset is tabular data designed for presentation, where variables form both the rows and columns, and column headers are values, not variable names. While I would call this arrangement messy, in some cases it can be extremely useful. It provides efficient storage for completely crossed designs, and it can lead to extremely efficient computation if desired operations can be expressed as matrix operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evictions data fits this description nicely. It's well suited -- even optimized -- for presentation and use in certain tools and types of analysis. But to answer our questions, the data is not in optimal form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tidy evictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for eviction are currently column headers. If we want to count reasons for eviction (for all time and by year), we'll need to transform them into values under a single, standardized column. We'll call this column `eviction_reason`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our end goal is to create one or more \"unpivoted\" data structures that enable us to more easily explore our questions. Here's an example of a tidy data structure that would make it easier to count and chart the reasons for eviction by year:\n",
    "\n",
    "![tidied-up-data-example](img/tidied_up_data_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data structure is \"long\". It contains far fewer columns and many more rows than our original data set. Each row represents a unique combination of an `eviction_id`, `year`, cause for eviction, and whether it was cited. We'll ultimately filter this data to retain only the rows for cited reasons, to avoid over-counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the critical first step is to transform the data into this form. Once we've tidied up the data, it will be much easier to filter, group and chart."

    "Tidy data helped explore our original questions, but are these findings reliable? In particular, is the steep decline in \"owner move-ins\" a real pattern or a data anomaly? Perhaps the city database allowed just one reason for eviction to be flagged in the early years, and harried government employees left the \"owner move-in\" option checked by default, clicked `Enter`, and moved on to more important matters...\n",

We should seek out government reports, news stories, and academic research that have tread similar ground. We should find someone -- perhaps a teammate or industry colleague -- to replicate or review our analysis.\n",

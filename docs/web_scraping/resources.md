# Web Scraping Resources

## Developer Tools

To lift the hood on a website and see how it works, you'll need to use a browser's developer tools:

-   [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
-   [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)


## Python libraries

Here are a few of the most popular workhorses in the Python community for web scraping tasks:

-   [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) to fetch web pages/files
-   [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for parsing HTML
-   [lxml](https://lxml.de/) for more serious HTML/XML parsing firepower (it's a "heavy" install but offers more speed and features than BeautifulSoup)
-   [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) for [stateful web scraping](101.md#stateful-web-scraping) and working with dynamic page content (among other thorny issues)

# Final Project Story Idea

## Goals

* Craft and present a well-articulated, quantifiable story question for the [Final Project - SF Data Analysis](/projects/sf_data_analysis.md).

## Craft and present story ideas

The second half of our course will focus on data wrangling and analysis with Python, culminating in a [final project](/projects/sf_data_analysis.md) presentation in Week 10.

The first step in that process involves identifying a story idea built around one or more *quantifiable* questions. These are questions that measure and/or compare things:

* Did home prices rise in the last month?
* Which neighborhood has the highest crime rate?
* What parts of the city are seeing the most housing develompent?

Working individually or on a team with one classmate, you will formulate a journalistically interesting question that can be explored using data from San Francisco.

The team should follow the guidelines laid out in the below sections of the [Project Phases](/projects/sf_data_analysis.md#project-phases) details for our final project.

* Generate an idea
* Assess and plan
* Present story idea

The final "deliverable" for this assignment is an in-class presentation of your story idea.

# More Python and Web Basics

## Goals

* Learn how Python functions can help us write more readable,  reliable and re-usable code.
* Learn basic sorting in Python.
* Level up on just enough web fundamentals to begin web scraping.


## Python reading and practice

* Read up on [sorting](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) through [Ascending and Descending](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#ascending-and-descending)
* Functions:
  * [Art of Writing Functions](/docs/python/art_of_functions.md)
  * [W3Schools Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
  * [Chapter 3 - Functions](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/) of *Automate the Boring Stuff*. As always, no need to do exercises. Just work through code examples to begin familiarizing yourself with the basics of Python functions.

## Web basics

Before we can learn how to scrape websites, it's important to have a basic understanding of the Internet and Web. The below are a few resources to help get your bearings. Please read, watch and work through the exercises, as appropriate, **before** arriving in class next week. If you fail to work through the below material, you'll likely be very confused as we ramp up on web scraping.

* Watch [The Internet in 5 Minutes (or Less)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc) and read [How does the Internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* Read [How the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)
* Read the following intros to HTML and CSS:
  * [HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
  * [HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) - this is part of a larger hands-on tutorial. It's well written and provides a good overview of the basics. Just skim this and ignore any instructions to create/modify HTML examples. 
  * [CSS Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_intro.asp)

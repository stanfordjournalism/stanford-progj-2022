## Services and Platforms

* Slack: Join the course Slack workspace through Canvas.
* Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Windows

Windows users will need to gain access to a Linux system.

### Data Journalism VM

We offer a Linux virtual machine with a graphical Desktop environment, pre-configured with most of the software you'll need for
the course. To use it:

* Download and [install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download the [data journalism virtual machine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c5gfwrm3ofmejk5/stanford-dj-vm.ova?dl=0)
* Follow the instructions in [this video](https://youtu.be/p2Ngy7smS78)
* Inside the Ubuntu VM:
  * Open the Terminal Emulator by double-clicking
  * Type `python setup/configure_system.py` in the shell and hit `return`/`enter`
  * Answer the questions when prompted

> Congrats! You're almost done. Skip to the [DataKit install](#datakit).

### VSCode and Windows Subsystem for Linux

For users on more modern versions of Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This provides a ready-made Linux shell environment (without a graphical Desktop) that integrates nicely with the Visual Studio Code Editor. 

Follow the instructions [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) to get up and running.

> With this option, you *will* need to perform the additional Linux setup steps described below.

## Code Editor

You'll need a text editor designed for writing code. Beginners should use [VSCode][]. More experienced users are free to use editors of their choosing.

## Shell Terminal

Mac and Linux both come with terminal programs, which provide a text-based interface to your operating system and related command-line tools. 

On Mac, use `Command + spacebar` to perform a Spotlight search for "Terminal".

For a more pleasant shell experience, we strongly recommend installing [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

## Version control

[Git][] is a [version control][] system we use to save and submit code and data for class assignments and projects.

[version control]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control

### Mac

Install [Homebrew][], a software package manager used on the command line. Then use Homebrew to install git.

Open a Terminal shell (see [above](#shell-terminal)) and run the below commands. Along the way, you'll be prompted to agree to Apple licensing terms and to provide your laptop password.

```
xcode-select --install

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew doctor
brew update
brew install git
```

> The commands above are based on Steps 1-3 of [How to Install Xcode, Homebrew, Git etc.](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/#laptop-script) See the blog post for more details.

### Linux

Open a terminal shell and run: 

```
sudo apt install git-all
```

## Python

**Python 3.7 - 3.8**

Before installing Python, first open a shell and run: `python --version`.

If you have a version between Python 3.7 and 3.8, you're all set.

If you have an older Python version (e.g. 2.7), follow the below instructions for Mac users.

### Mac

Mac users will use Homebrew to install Python. At a high level, the
process involves installing a tool called [pyenv][]. This tool allows
you to install and manage multiple versions of Python.

We'll use it to install Python 3.8.12 (the latest version of 3.8 at the
time of writing).

First, open a Terminal and make sure your shell is set to bash (newer Macs default to zsh):

```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Close and re-open the Terminal.

Then run the below commands.

> Execute the below commands one by one (i.e. copy and paste each row
> individually rather than all the commands at once).

```bash
# Note, some of these commands can take several minutes to run!!

brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.8.12
pyenv global 3.8.12
```

Then run the below commands to configure your shell, per the [pyenv docs for bashrc on Mac](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout).

> Below is the workflow if no `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/ .bashrc` already exist, which apparently is default on Macs.

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'if [ -n "$PS1" -a -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then source ~/.bashrc; fi' >> ~/.profile

echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Close and restart the Terminal.

Type `python --version`, which should return 3.8.12

> If you do not see Python 3.8 at the end of this process, please reach
> out for help.

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[git]: https://git-scm.com/
[VSCode]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[pyenv]: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

### Linux

Use [pyenv][], a tool that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Python. Run these commands from a shell:

```
# Clone pyenv
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv

# Add pyenv vars to bash config
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reinitialize shell
exec "$SHELL"

# Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

# Install python version 3.7.6
pyenv install 3.7.6
pyenv global 3.7.6
```

## Configure

Open a Terminal/shell. 

Download and run our configuration script. You'll need to answer a few questions along the way.

```
cd ~

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanfordjournalism/stanford-dj-vm/master/configure_system.py

python configure_system.py
```

The configuration script will prompt you to peform a few additional steps:

1. [Upload your ssh public key to GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
1. [Create a GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
1. Open `~/.datakit/plugins/datakit-github/config.json` and replace `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` with the actual token from GitHub.

## DataKit

> Before this step, make sure you've completed *all* [configuration](#configure) described above.

[DataKit][] is a command-line tool we'll use to manage code and data for class assignments. It provides a standardized structure for projects and allows us to easily submit code to GitHub.

Run the following command to install DataKit:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanfordjournalism/cookiecutter-stanford-progj/master/requirements.txt | xargs pip install
```

Follow [these instructions](datakit.md#first-project) to complete the DataKit setup.

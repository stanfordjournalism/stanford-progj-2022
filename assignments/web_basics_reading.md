# Web Basics

Before we can learn how to scrape websites, it's important to have a basic understanding of the Internet and Web. The below are a few resources to help get your bearings. Please read, watch and work through the exercises, as appropriate, **before** arriving in class next week. If you fail to work through the below material, you'll likely be very confused as we ramp up on web scraping.

* Watch [The Internet in 5 Minutes (or Less)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc) and read [How does the Internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* Read [How the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)
* Read the following intros to HTML and CSS:
  * [HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
  * [HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) - this is part of a larger hands-on tutorial. It's well written and provides a good overview of the basics. Just skim this and ignore any instructions to create/modify HTML examples.

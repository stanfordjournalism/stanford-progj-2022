# Web Scraping Exercises

Below are a few exercises to help practice web scraping.

-   [Texas Executed Offenders][] - Scrape the list of offender data and save it to a CSV. *Bonus points*: Scrape the `Last Statement` for each offender. This will require extracting links from the `Last Statement` field and scraping those pages as well.
-   [Stanford Events](https://events.stanford.edu/) - Scrape the event url and metadata.
-   [Palo Alto Agendas and Minutes][] - Generate a CSV of links to all agendas for current year. *Bonus points*:Download the actual agendas and minutes.
-   [FDIC failed banks][] - Generate a CSV containing all the bank data on the index page. *Bonus points*: Scrape two pieces of data from the balance sheet pages for each bank. This will require harvesting links from the `Bank Name` field and using those links to scrape the "detail" pages for each bank.

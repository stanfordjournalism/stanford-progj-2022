# How to succeed in this course

If you're new(ish) to programming, be prepared to invest quite a few hours *outside of class* as you level up on new skills. This is a good thing. The more time invested, the more quickly you'll gain fluency and comfort.

That said, **don’t** beat your head on the keyboard for 8 hours just to discover a missing colon in your code!

If you've put in an honest effort, researched and tried various solutions, then it's time to reach out to a classmate or instructor for help. I call this the *15-minute rule*. It's an incredibly effective strategy for punching through a problem. Often, the simple act of explaining the problem to someone will reveal the solution.

Here are a few other suggestions and rules of the road for our course:

- **Be kind**. We have a ZERO-tolerance policy on "techtosterone". Both in and out of class, create an environment where classmates feel comfortable asking questions and seeking help.
 - **Adopt a [growth mindset](https://ctl.stanford.edu/growth-mindset)**. Programming is a skill that anyone can learn. Put anxiety on "time-out" and trust that you too can do this.
- **Collaborate**. We all bring different experiences and perspectives to our work. Share your knowledge, *listen* to the contributions of others, and offer constructive feedback as we tackle assignments and projects.
* **Put in the work**. Learning to code is like learning a new language. The more reps you put in, in and out of class, the more quickly you'll learn. Make coding a part of each day by finding ways to apply it outside of this class.
- **Unleash your curiosity**. Be ambitious in your project ideas. Explore interesting technical nooks and crannies. Ask questions in or out of class. If we can’t answer them straight off, we can explore them together.

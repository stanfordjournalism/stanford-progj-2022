# Goals

* Learn how DataKit is used to help streamline data projects in the news
* Level up on Python lists and dictionaries

## Read about DataKit

* [Poynter article](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2019/data-journalism-solves-big-problems-but-its-an-organizational-mess-a-new-tool-from-the-ap-aims-to-fix-that/) on Datakit provides a nice overview
* [AP's DataKit: Helping Teams collaborate efficiently](https://www.rjionline.org/stories/ap-datakit-intro), by RJI, gets into more details on DataKit's origin story and capabilities.


## Python reading and practice

Read and work through the following:

> **NOTE: You don't have to do the exercises in Automate the Boring Stuff, but you should type in the commands for code examples throughout the text. Use a standard interactive Python shell by typing `python` or `ipython` (if you've installed the latter).** 

* Lists
	* Read [Automate's Chapter 4 on Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/) and **stop right before** the section titled *Example Program: Magic 8 Ball with a List*.
	* Do the [W3C schools lists exercise](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_lists1)

* Dictionaries (key/value mappings)
	* Read the top two sections in [Automate's Chapter 5 on Dictionaries ](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/): *The Dictionary Data Type* and *Dictionaries vs. Lists*
	*  [W3C schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) - Review all sections on dictionary syntax and work through the [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dictionaries1) at the end.
